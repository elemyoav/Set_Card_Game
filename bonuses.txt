BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

    1. We used only the configuration fields for setting up the game. 

    2. It was used in classes player dealer timer and table effectivly in all methods.

    3. We tested it works correctly by changing configuration fields and checking it works in extreme cases.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

    1. We used the interrupts in order to make this work, and the terminate functions.

    2. We implemented this via the terminate methods in dealer and player.

    3. We tested it works correctly via the log files.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

    1. We implemented this with the timer thread. if turnTimeoutMillis < 0 it was not started and when
    config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0 it was started backwards

    2. It was used in the dealer shouldFinish method and in all methods in Timer class.

    3. We tested this by changing the config.turnTimeoutMillis field in the config file and running the game multiple times. 

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
